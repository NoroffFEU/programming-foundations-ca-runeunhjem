# **** Programming Foundations CA ****

## The real life object I will be describing as an object is my TV.

---

#### **_NOTE TO CA:_**

The actual CA is in the js/myTv_CA.js file.
In the file I have // commented lines both for helping me
remember and understand as I am going through the assignment,
but also to show how I think they are ment to work.

### *** Description of my object ***
##### OBJECT: TV ####
  It has the following properties:

    brand: "Samsung", (String) The manufacturer of the TV
    displayType: "QLED", (String) The type of display used in the TV
    screenSize: 65, (Number) The size of the TV
    resolution: "4K", (String) The TV's screen resolution
    hdrSupport: true, (Boolean) The TV has HDR (High Dynamic Range) support
    smartTv: true, (Boolean) The TV has built in internet and smart features like apps
    tvIsOn: true, (Boolean) Is the TV on or off. Tells the current powerstate
    activeTvSource: "PC", (String) What is the current source showing on the TV
    availableInputs: ["TV", "PC", "Playstation 5", "Chromecast"], (Array) Available inputs
    availableApps: [
      "Netflix",
      "Disney",
      "Viaplay",
      "HBO Max",
      "discovery+",
      "TV2 Play",
      "YouTube",
      "Spotify",
    ], (Array) Available installed apps on the TV
    currentVolume: 40, (Number) States current volumelevel on the TV
    adjustVolume: function (volume) {
      if (volume >= 0 && volume <= 100) {
        this.currentVolume = volume;        
        console.log(`Volumelevel is now set to ${volume}`);
      } else {
          console.log("Volume level is out of range and invalid");
        }
    }, (Function) Function to console.log current volume level
    changeInput: function (input) {
      if (this.availableInputs.includes(input)) {
        console.log(`Changing input to ${input}`);
      } else {
        console.log("This input does not exist on this TV");
      }
    },  (Function) Function to console.log current active input
    changeApps: function (apps) {
      if (this.availableApps.includes(apps)) {
        console.log(`Switching to the ${apps} App`);
      } else {
        console.log(
          "This app is not installed on this TV. Please download and install to use it"
        );
      }
    } (Function) Function to console.log current active app

##### Using the browser's console we can see the results of calling the functions:

  **Running the functions to check if they work as they should in the console:**

    tv.adjustVolume(70); // adjust currentVolume to 70 (REMEMBER that adjustVolume is a property of tv)
    tv.adjustVolume(101); // adjust currentVolume to 101 wich is not within the 0 and 100 required in the if(volume...
    console.log("Doublecheck", tv.currentVolume); // Doublecheck currentVolume
    tv.changeInput("pc"); // Does not exist due to lowerCaps (remember tv. first)
    tv.changeInput("TV"); // Does exist (remember tv. first)
    tv.changeApps("Youtube"); // Does not exist due to lowercase t (remember tv. first)
    tv.changeApps("YouTube"); // Does exist (remember tv. first)
    tv.changeApps("HBO Max"); // Does exist (remember tv. first)

#### **_ NOTE TO OPTIONAL / EXTRA:_**
  Wanted to make a GUI of the TV with a remote to control
  the different inputs, apps and controls.
  
  The code from the CA is also in the js/tv.js file.
  Also added and linked to js/optional.js in the index.html
  as well as adding the style.css to style it all.
  
  In the js files I have // commented lines both for helping me
  remember and understand as I am going through the assignment,
  but also to show how I think they are ment to work.
  
  The inputs roughly represent the inputs on my actual TV.
  **Input buttons:**
  TV, PC, PS 5, Chromecast
  
  **App buttons:**
  Netflix, Disney, Viaplay, HBO Max, discovery+, TV2 Play, YouTube, Spotify
  
  **Control buttons:**
  Power, Volume slider and HDR
  
  It is pretty self-explanitory how the buttons work, and what they do,
  so I do not feel I need to add that in here.
  
  I have only made this mobile size, as I have more than enough
  to wrap my brain around with the JS aspect of the assignment.
  
  So does this mean I fully understand JS?
  Absolutely not, but by trial and error and looking up examples,
  I am pretty happy with the result of my very first JS assignment.
