# **** Programming Foundations CA ****

## The real life object I will be describing as an object is my TV.

---

NOTE TO CA:
The actual CA is in the js/myTv_CA.js file
In the file I have // commented lines both for helping me
remember and understand as I am going through the assignment,
but also to show how I think they are ment to work.

*** Description of my object ***
OBJECT: TV
It has the following properties:

  brand: "Samsung", (// )String
  displayType: "QLED", // String
  screenSize: 65, // Number
  resolution: "4K", // String
  hdrSupport: true, // Boolean
  smartTv: true, // Boolean
  tvIsOn: true, // Boolean
  activeTvSource: "PC", // String
  availableInputs: ["TV", "PC", "Playstation 5", "Chromecast"], // Array
  availableApps: [
    "Netflix",
    "Disney",
    "Viaplay",
    "HBO Max",
    "discovery+",
    "TV2 Play",
    "YouTube",
    "Spotify",
  ], // Array
  currentVolume: 40, // Number

---

NOTE TO OPTIONAL / EXTRA:
Wanted to make a GUI of the TV with a remote to control
the different inputs, apps and controls.

The code from the CA is also in the js/tv.js file.
Also added and linked to js/optional.js in the index.html
as well as adding the style.css to style it all.

In the js files I have // commented lines both for helping me
remember and understand as I am going through the assignment,
but also to show how I think they are ment to work.

The inputs roughly represent the inputs on my actual TV.
Input buttons:
TV, PC, PS 5, Chromecast

App buttons:
Netflix, Disney, Viaplay, HBO Max, discovery+, TV2 Play, YouTube, Spotify

Control buttons:
Power, Volume slider and HDR

It is pretty self-explanitory how the buttons work, and what they do,
so I do not feel I need to add that in here.

I have only made this mobile size, as I have more than enough
to wrap my brain around with the JS aspect of the assignment.

So does this mean I fully understand JS?
Absolutely not, but by trial and error and looking up examples,
I am pretty happy with the result of my very first JS assignment.
