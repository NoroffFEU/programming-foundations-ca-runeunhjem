# ****\***** Programming Foundations CA ****\*****

# The real life object I will be describing as an object is my TV.

---

NOTE TO CA:
The actual CA is in the js/myTv_CA.js file
In the file I have // commented lines both for helping me
remember and understand as I am going through the assignment,
but also to show how I think they are ment to work.

---

NOTE TO OPTIONAL / EXTRA:
Wanted to make a GUI of the TV with a remote to control
the different inputs, apps and controls.

The code from the CA is also in the js/tv.js file.
Also added and linked to js/optional.js in the index.html
as well as adding the style.css to style it all.

In the js files I have // commented lines both for helping me
remember and understand as I am going through the assignment,
but also to show how I think they are ment to work.

The inputs roughly represent the inputs on my actual TV.
Input buttons:
TV, PC, PS 5, Chromecast

App buttons:
Netflix, Disney, Viaplay, HBO Max, discovery+, TV2 Play, YouTube, Spotify

Control buttons:
Power, Volume slider and HDR
